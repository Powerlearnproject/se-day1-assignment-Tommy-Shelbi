Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the procedural application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high- qality software systems through the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products. It is important to the technology industry because it makes the creation of systems and software applications which play a major role in modern human lives possible, including entertainment, communication, healthcare and commerce


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
the advent of structured programming in the 1970s
the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.

Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user 
interface.

Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design 
specifications.

Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and 
functional requirements.

Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.

Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is about a sequential approach, taking things in order  For example, Developing a compliance-based software system for a financial institution with strict regulations where the requirements are clearly defined and unlikely to change.while agile is an incremental one focused on flexibility, collaboration and adaptability by being responsive to change, Building a new mobile application for a startup where user needs and market conditions are likely to evolve rapidly, requiring ongoing iteration and flexibility.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs enhance developer productivity and consolidate various development tools in one environment, streamlining tasks e.g Visual Studio
VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously while tracking changes and preventing conflicts and provides a complete history of code changes, allowing developers to revert to previous versions and understand the evolution of the codebase. eg Github


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenge: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep, project delays, and potential misalignment with initial goals.
Strategy: Adopt Agile methodologies that embrace iterative development and regular feedback loops, allowing the project to adapt to changing requirements while maintaining focus on delivering value.

Challenge: The pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development, leading to compromised code quality and increased risk of bugs.
Strategy: Prioritize tasks using techniques like the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) and ensure clear communication with stakeholders about realistic timelines and potential trade-offs.

Challenge: Accrued technical debt from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions can hinder future development efforts and increase maintenance costs, making it difficult to scale or enhance the software.
Strategy: Regularly allocate time for refactoring and code reviews, and make technical debt visible to the team and stakeholders to prioritize paying it down before it becomes a significant burden.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing
Involves testing individual components or units of the software in isolation, typically at the function or method level. It  helps verify that each component of the software works as intended.

integration testing
Focuses on verifying the interactions between different modules or components of the software. It ensures that the units work together as expected when combined.

system testing
A comprehensive test of the complete, integrated software application. It examines the system's behavior under various conditions, ensuring that it meets the specified requirements.

acceptance testing
Performed to determine whether the software meets the business requirements and is ready for delivery to the end-users. This type of testing is often conducted by the client or end-users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt
"Write an architecture essay."
Improved prompt
"Write a 1,500-word essay analyzing the influence of the Gothic architectural style on modern-day skyscraper design. Discuss how elements like pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses have been reinterpreted in contemporary architecture. Provide examples from at least two major cities and reference architectural studies from the last decade."

Explanation:
Clarity: The improved prompt identifies the topic—Gothic architectural influence on modern skyscrapers—eliminating any ambiguity about what to write.

Specificity: The prompt specifies the elements to focus on (e.g., pointed arches, and ribbed vaults) and requires examples from specific contexts (major cities), making it easier for the writer to know what to include.

Conciseness: The prompt succinctly conveys all necessary details, ensuring that the writer understands the scope, length, and expectations.
